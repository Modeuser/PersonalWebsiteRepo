  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Current robotics programmer (and master's student) at
    <span class="hover-image-trigger color-cmu">
      Carnegie Mellon University
      <img src="assets/Brian@CMU.jpg" alt="CMU Hover Image" class="hover-image" />
    </span>
    developing control interfaces in game/physics engines for humanoid robots.
    Previously co-founded
    <span class="hover-image-trigger color-hirn">
      HIRN Interactive
      <img src="assets/Brian@HIRN.jpg" alt="HIRN Hover Image" class="hover-image" />
    </span>
    making virtual reality software for neuroscience research communication. And prior to that,
    Honours bachelor's of science at the
    <span class="hover-image-trigger color-uoft">
      University of Toronto
      <img src="assets/Brian@UofT.jpg" alt="UofT Hover Image" class="hover-image" />
    </span>, with a focus in computational neuroscience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tried using silicon computers to understand the fleshy computers,
    gave up after realizing the fleshy computers are too dang complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nowadays I'm more interested in robotics, computer vision, graphics, VR/AR/MR,
    and occasionally revisiting my roots in neuroscience.
    There's a surprising amount of overlap across these fields, both in their applications and underlying principles.
    Linear algebra and vector calculus never seems to go out of style in these fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I doubt there's a job where I get to combine all of these interests,
    I will continue to hone my fundamentals until the day that job comes along.

      <h3>Custom split keyboard</h3>
      <p>
        Made my own custom 3D printed split keyboard with PCB from Keebio, Sakurio switch stems from Zeal Generation,
        shoved into Holy Panda housing @ 67g of actuation force.
      </p>
      <p>
        I flashed a custom firmware written in C that would make the rotary encoder on the PCB run different
        macros when different modifier keys are held (e.g. when holding ctrl, spinning it counter-clock-wise
        is undo (ctrl+z), spinning it clock-wise is redo (ctrl+shift+z))
