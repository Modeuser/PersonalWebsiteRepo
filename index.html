  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Current robotics programmer (and master's student) at
    <span class="hover-image-trigger">
      Carnegie Mellon University
      <img src="assets/project2.jpg" alt="CMU Hover Image" class="hover-image" />
    </span>
    developing control interfaces in game/physics engines for humanoid robots.
    Previously co-founded a startup company making
    virtual reality software for neuroscience research communication. And prior to that,
    Honours bachelor's of science at the University of Toronto, with a focus in computational neuroscience.

  <p>
    Tried using silicon computers to understand the fleshy computers,
    gave up after realizing the fleshy computers are too dang complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nowadays I'm more interested in robotics, computer vision, graphics, VR/AR/MR,
    and occasionally revisiting my roots in neuroscience.
    There's a surprising amount of overlap across these fields, both in their applications and underlying principles.
    Linear algebra and vector calculus never seems to go out of style in these fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I doubt there's a job where I get to combine all of these interests,
    I will continue to hone my fundamentals until the day that job comes along.
